  <p>With over 20 years of experience in web design and development, I find teaching to be a greatly rewarding practice. I am a thought-provoking educator who has taught numerous classes about the value of user experience and engineering approaches. I use everyday ideas and tasks to describe complex concepts. This is often evaluated by the students as more informative than common bootcamp methods.</p>
