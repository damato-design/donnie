My work in higher education has centered around bridging industry and academia, ensuring that students and professionals alike gain the skills needed to thrive in UX design and front-end engineering. I’ve developed curricula, led courses, and mentored students, focusing on real-world applications rather than just theory. By integrating modern design systems thinking and front-end best practices into education, I’ve helped shape programs that prepare learners to build scalable, user-centered digital experiences.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve contributed to research, workshops, and speaking engagements that explore the evolving landscape of design and development. I believe education should be as dynamic as the field itself, so I emphasize hands-on learning, collaboration, and critical thinking. Whether guiding students, mentoring professionals, or refining educational strategies, my goal has always been to make complex topics accessible and actionable for the next generation of designers and engineers.
