My work in front-end engineering has always been about bridging the gap between design and development. I specialize in building scalable, maintainable UI architectures that empower teams to ship high-quality experiences with consistency and efficiency. From crafting robust component libraries to optimizing performance and accessibility, I focus on writing clean, reusable code that stands the test of time. I believe great front-end engineering isn’t just about pixels and code—it’s about creating seamless, intuitive interactions that feel effortless for users.

I’ve worked extensively on enterprise applications, design systems, and complex web experiences, always ensuring that the underlying code is as thoughtfully designed as the UI itself. Whether it’s streamlining workflows for designers and developers, improving performance for large-scale applications, or advocating for best practices in accessibility and maintainability, I bring a strategic mindset to front-end development. At the core, my goal is to make the web more intuitive, performant, and inclusive—one line of code at a time.
