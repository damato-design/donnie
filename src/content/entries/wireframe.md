I’ve been an AV nerd for a long time. In one of the first iterations of my personal website, I had something called “Audio Phrekwenci” (pronounced “frequency”), which was an audio blog of sporadic release. I’d record my ramblings to a microphone, edit in some free software, and publish it on my personal server. I had some friends listen to it ever so often and it was fun to talk about.

Since then, I’ve always had the itch to do it again. But one thing was always holding me back; editing. Traditional editing is painful and time-consuming. Now, that technology has come a long way and text-based editing has appeared, it’s finally time to give it a go in a new show called Wireframe.
