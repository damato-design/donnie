In the design community, constraints are often seen as creativity’s enemy. A cage that stifles imagination and expression. But what if this common belief is exactly backward? This talk challenges the myth that “unbounded creativity” leads to better user experiences.

Drawing on Karl Duncker’s famous Candle Problem and the global sensation of MacGyver, we’ll explore the cognitive bias known as functional fixedness. How our minds get stuck seeing things only one way, limiting innovation. By embracing constraints, from user needs and product requirements to brand guidelines and technical boundaries, we unlock a richer, more focused kind of creativity.

This talk argues for mastering the resources and rules you are given to solve problems effectively within the box. Design systems aren’t meant to fight creativity; they are the scaffolding that helps teams support consistent, user-centered solutions while delivering a package of thoughtful design expressions.
