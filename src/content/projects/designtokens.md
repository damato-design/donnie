While writing a book focusing on Mise en Mode, I realized that many of terms that I understood in the design systems practices were not totally agreed upon and had no central source to point to for discussion. For several years I've seen terms be misunderstood or misused to describe different concepts. This is especially detrimental to our practice because our organizations are trying to gain agreement. In order to achieve this, we need to be speaking the same language.

I create this project to fill the gaps in our community. The first release has nearly 3 dozen terms that are specific to the world of design tokens, theming, and, naming conventions we used to discuss the best practices in our industry. The project has plans to provide an open-source way for community updates in the future.
