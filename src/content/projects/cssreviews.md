For many years of my professional career, folks have had difficulty properly assessing skills in UI engineering. This often stems from engineering organizations that prioritize traditional engineering skills and de-emphasize the craft of making a responsive, accessible, and performant interface for the product.

I've launched this as a starting point to help build awareness for this gap in hiring individuals with this expertise. In the beginning it will act like a consultancy, but I have larger plans to create a platform where UI engineers and hiring managers can connect to find the right match of talent and product.
