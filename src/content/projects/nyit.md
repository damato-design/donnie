After finishing my Master's degree in Communication Arts and using my experience in the live event production space prior, I was invited to teach a few courses focusing on live event production to new students. The course expected students to create a handful of live shows meant to be streamed over the internet.

In the course, the students learned the value of preproduction and how to respond to unplanned circumstances. The motto "the show must go on" enforced a responsibility to their audience. They also got involved in other facets of supplimental media, such as holding a positive social presence and building brand awareness.
