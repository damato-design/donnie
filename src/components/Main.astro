        <p>Hey, I'm Donnie! ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a Design Systems Architect with a passion for making design and code work beautifully together. With a background in user-experience design, front-end engineering, and higher education, I build systems that arenâ€™t just component librariesâ€”theyâ€™re strategic frameworks that help teams move faster and smarter.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve tackled everything from enterprise applications to accessibility-first design solutions, always keeping users and maintainability in mind. I love bridging the gap between designers and developers, turning chaos into cohesion with scalable, intuitive systems.</p>
        <p>I also have a strong connection to higher education, where Iâ€™ve mentored, taught, and shaped curricula in UX and web technologies. Sharing knowledge is just as important to me as building great systemsâ€”because the best design systems donâ€™t just scale products, they scale people too.</p>
